For backend API, we utilize dotnet. We can check our version of dotnet by 
dotnet --version

This was a custom API build having three folders houses different classes?

We seed a database with data using SQL Lite because this database is transferrable. But it will change later.


Installing our React app, we check versions similarly:
node --version
npm --version

We use the following terminal command to have a typescript template already setup. This provides a tsconfig file


npx create-react-app client-app --use-npm --template typescript

We are utilizing Semantic UI React and it doesn't need any other setups eventhough we are using Typescript.
